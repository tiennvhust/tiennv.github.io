        <h1>Omnidirectional Robot Prototype Development</h1>
        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The original AI-assisted sonification algorithm was first introduced in [1]. This algorithm utilizes the Phase Vocoder (PV) algorithm with an AI-guided time-compression factor as an attention mechanism. It combines AI algorithms' accuracy and speed with sonification's interpretability and intuitiveness to enable a quick, accurate, and interpretable seizure detection method requiring little to no medical workers' training. A real-time adaptation of this algorithm was developed to overcome the limitations in the offline-processing approach in previous studies, it allowes output audio to be always available for listening. Medical workers can have access to real-time audio at any time without having to periodically restart the sonification algorithm, enabling seizure detection as soon as they occur. This new adaptation has modifications in the architecture and algorithm implementation. While the original algorithm was implemented in Matlab, its real-time adaptation was implemented in C/C++ using the available open-source mathematic libraries. A thorough comparison was performed to guarantee the unchanged performance of the AI-assisted sonification algorithm in real-time implementation.</p>
